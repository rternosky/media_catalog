Things I want the system to have:

1. Auth system with roles:
   * Reader (Read Only access to data)
   * Editor (Can add/edit/remove entries)
   * Administrator (Can edit system settings)

2. Book Catalog
   * View catalog similar to Plex
     * Cover (small) view
     * Order by Author, Title by default
     * Sort options (multi sort)
     * Filter options (Genre, year, format, rating)
     * Alphabetic Jump Index down side like Plex
   * Click to get to detail screen like Plex
   * Edit option on detail screen, perhaps from thumbnail like Plex
   * Rating system from thumbnail
   * Add/Edit utilize OpenLibrary API
     * Search by Author, Title, ISBN
     * Display search results including edition information
     * Select to update form on add/edit path
     * Add/remove/update cover images
       * multiple sizes for thumb vs detail screens
     * Save button creates/update entries
   * Remove - archive not remove
   * Export - as XLS DB data

3. Music
   * View catalog, similar to Plex - BUT different layout on filesystem
     * Cover (small) view
     * Order by Album Artist, Album Title by default
     * Sort options (multi sort)
     * Filter options (Genre, year, rating)
     * Alphabetic Jump Index down side like Plex
   * Click to get to detail screen like Plex
   * Edit option on detail screen, perhaps from thumbnail like Plex
   * Rating system from thumbnail
   * Add/Edit
     * Scan from filesystem for Add
       * Write .mediaserver file to link to DB IDs
     * Edit does tag editing and filesystem changing as well as DB update
     * External images for thumb/detail/ID3 image to be used
     * Scan for diffs option to detect filesystem changes - new additions/moves/renames/tag updates
       * Tag data considered authoritative for ID3 info.
   * Remove - Archive don't remove. Consider how this affects scan option
   * Export - as XLS ID3 info
   * Much later:
     Streaming, playlists

4. Photos
   * TBD

5. Videos
   * TBD

6. Top level Search
   * Search by name, title across media types or select media type

7. Administration
   * Permission Management
   * Role Management: Group perms -> roles
   * User Management: username, password, group assignment
   * Server Settings that we make configurables
